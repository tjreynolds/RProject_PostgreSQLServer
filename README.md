RProject_PostgreSQLServer
=========================

A PostGreSQL server for hosting R, for the statprog project on Github. This server will interface with applications

Univeristy of San Francisco. For more information about the project, contact rmhorton on Github.

Remaining tasks:
-Finish provisioning virtual machine, especially with GIS and other plugins for PostGreSQL.
-Design PostGreSQL database, likely with data from <https://github.com/WinVector/zmPDSwR/tree/master/PUMS/loadExample>.
-Create interworking Python/Vagrant/Fabric scripting for automatic deployment on final server.

Nothing too hard, right?
